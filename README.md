# Computer Vision Using Tensorflow
#### Summer Project offered by IITK Consulting Group
#### Project mentors: Aryan Vora, Mandar Wayal

## Overview
The project focuses on how to use Tensorflow 2.0 in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
Using Convolutional Neural Networks, we will classify images of people into three categories: not wearing mask, wearing mask correctly and wearing mask incorrectly.

## Assignment 1

The motive of this assignment is to make predictions using Linear Regression. To make sure you truly understand how the underlying algorithm works, you are to implement it from scratch.

## Assignment 2

Learn to build Neural Networks using Tensorflow.

## Assignment 3

In this Assignment, we will use CNN to classify digits in the MNIST database.
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
